As a Baptist Christian, I believe in fostering strong connections within our community. 
My church has a long tradition of fellowship with other Baptist churches in Venezuela, some of which we helped establish.
Inspired by this spirit of collaboration, I created this website, https://jm-mogo.github.io/venezuelaMissionaryMap/, to help members of all Baptist churches connect and learn more about each other. 
Here, you can find information like church names, locations, and pastors. 
Explore the website and discover the vibrant Baptist community in Venezuela!
